# Face-Detection-using-HAAR-CASCADE-and-OpenCV

### Overview:
One older (from around 2001), but still popular scheme for face detection is a Haar cascade classifier; these classifiers in the OpenCV library and use feature-based classification cascades that learn to isolate and detect faces in an image.

### Requirements:
